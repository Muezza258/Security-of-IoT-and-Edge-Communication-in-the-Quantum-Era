Security of IoT and Edge Communication in the Quantum Era: Threat Models, Assumptions, and Viable Defenses
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge communication systems form the backbone of modern cyber–physical infrastructure, enabling large-scale sensing, control, and autonomous decision-making under strict resource constraints. The security of these systems currently relies on classical public-key cryptographic primitives whose hardness assumptions are threatened by the emergence of large-scale quantum computation. Unlike traditional security transitions, the quantum threat introduces a temporal asymmetry: data encrypted today may remain vulnerable to retrospective decryption once quantum adversaries mature. This “store-now, decrypt-later” paradigm is particularly critical for IoT and edge systems, where devices are long-lived, computationally constrained, and often deployed in hostile or unattended environments. The central problem addressed in this work is to determine how quantum-capable adversaries fundamentally alter the security assumptions of IoT and edge communication systems, and to identify which classes of cryptographic defenses remain viable under realistic system and adversary constraints.
