## Attack 1: Store-Now-Decrypt-Later (SNDL) Attack
This is the foundational attack in the quantum era, so we start here.
The store-now-decrypt-later (SNDL) attack exploits the temporal decoupling between data transmission and cryptanalytic capability in quantum-adversarial environments. In this attack, an adversary passively records encrypted communication exchanged between IoT devices and edge nodes without attempting real-time decryption. The captured ciphertexts are archived for long-term storage until sufficiently powerful quantum computational resources become available.\\
Once a fault-tolerant quantum computer is realized, the adversary retroactively applies quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s algorithm, to recover the long-term cryptographic secrets underlying classical public-key mechanisms. This enables decryption of previously recorded traffic, even though the communication was cryptographically secure at the time of transmission. Consequently, confidentiality guarantees become time-dependent rather than absolute, violating traditional security assumptions.\\
The SNDL attack is particularly severe in IoT and edge systems due to the long operational lifetime of deployed devices, which often exceeds the anticipated timeline for practical quantum computing. Moreover, the resource constraints of IoT devices discourage frequent key rotation or post-deployment cryptographic upgrades, further extending the vulnerability window. As a result, sensitive telemetry, control commands, and contextual metadata remain exposed to future compromise.\\
Under the assumed adversary model, the SNDL attack does not require active network manipulation, physical device access, or protocol deviation. Instead, it relies solely on passive eavesdropping combined with delayed cryptanalysis, making it stealthy, low-cost, and difficult to detect. This property renders conventional intrusion detection and anomaly-based defenses ineffective against SNDL attacks.
